* Add one link per Pull Request.
    * Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add project-name`.
    * Write down the reason why the work is awesome.
* Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Don't mention `Python` in the description as it's implied.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.
